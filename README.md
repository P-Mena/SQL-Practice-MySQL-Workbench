# 🗃️ SQL Practice – MySQL Workbench Exercises

This repository contains my practical SQL exercises completed using **MySQL Workbench**.  
The goal of this project is to build a strong foundation in SQL by practicing real queries on well-known sample databases.

---

## 🛠️ Setup

1. I downloaded and installed **MySQL Workbench**.  
2. I imported two popular practice databases into MySQL Workbench:
   - **Northwind**
   - **World**
3. I began working directly on these databases to practice different SQL concepts.

## 📌 Database 1: Northwind

### 🔹 Basic SQL Queries

I started by practicing fundamental SQL operations on the **Northwind** database:

- `SELECT * FROM table`
- Filtering with `WHERE`
- Logical operators:
  - `AND`
  - `OR`
  - `=`
  - `>`
  - `<`
  - `BETWEEN`
- Sorting results with `ORDER BY`
